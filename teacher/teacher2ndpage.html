        <p>The Group Trivia is a three-four people team based activity where all members have to give the same correct answer to get points in a given time. These questions will help them to develop their logical thinking, problem solving and critical thinking while interacting with each other. Feedback will be sent to the lecturer as well. Questions can be customised by the lecturer if needed.
